My name is Joelle Chase and I am currently working towards earning my Masters in Education in Learning, Design, and Technology (click <a href="index2.html">HERE</a> to learn more!). This is my third semester in the program and I am excited to graduate this December. I was previously a special education teacher for Wake County Public Schools, but resigned from this area in November of 2021. I am now an Educational Navigator for Central Carolina Community College.
