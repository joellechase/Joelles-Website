<u>About Me</u>
<br/>
My name is Joelle Chase and I am currently working towards earning my Masters in Education in Learning, Design, and Technology. This is my third semester in the program and I am excited to graduate this December. I was previously a special education teacher for Wake County Public Schools, but resigned from this area. I am now an Educational Navigator for Central Carolina Community College.
